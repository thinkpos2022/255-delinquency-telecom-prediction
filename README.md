**Purpose of the project**
The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive data mining analysis to help telecom companies gain better insights into whether their customers might be late or miss payments. Given the large number of attributes in the dataset, we aim to identify the most significant features that impact customer delinquency. By building a model to predict potential payment issues, telecom companies can understand what causes these delays allowing them to design specific strategies to address and reduce delinquency.
