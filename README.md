**Purpose of the project**
The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive data mining analysis to help telecom companies gain better insights into whether their customers might be late or miss payments. Given the large number of attributes in the dataset, we aim to identify the most significant features that impact customer delinquency. By building a model to predict potential payment issues, telecom companies can understand what causes these delays allowing them to design specific strategies to address and reduce delinquency.

**About dataset**:
The Delinquency Telecom Dataset provides insights into how customers handle their phone credits, with a focus on payments and recharging. It reveals if a user repaid a borrowed credit within 5 days. This dataset has  209,593 rows and 36 columns, showing users' mobile numbers, how much they spend daily and their average credit left with particular attention to 30-day and 90-day intervals. It further highlights credit borrowing patterns, including the number of credits taken, the borrowed amounts, and when they are paid back. The dataset also includes the customer's telecom region. All monetary figures are presented in Indonesian currency. This comprehensive data assists telecom companies in forecasting potential payment challenges.
